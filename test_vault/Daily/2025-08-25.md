### wxWidgets Learning
Made excellent progress today! Created a comprehensive tutorial series covering:

1. Basic application structure
2. Event handling
3. Layout management with sizers
4. Menus and toolbars

### Custom Obsidian App
Successfully built the foundation:

## Notes

The wxWidgets framework is quite powerful for cross-platform GUI development. The event system is intuitive and the layout management with sizers works well.

Key learnings:
- Always use sizers for layout
- Event tables vs Bind() method
- AUI (Advanced User Interface) for dockable panels
- Scintilla text control for code editing
